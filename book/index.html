                <p class="gapB1">Schools cover a broad range of subjects because the basics are rightly considered relevant to all careers. But schools simplify for young minds. College cannot update it all because the focus is narrow by definition. But even the basics are more nuanced than school taught, not to mention the updates to human knowledge over the decades since you were at school.</p>

                <p class="gapB1">The forthcoming, untitled book presents new angles for looking at the world, across a wide range of topics. First halves of chapters are aimed at anyone who is curious and wants to understand more and better. The second halves of chapters can variously serve researchers writing proposals, people who design and improve products or campaigns, journalists and writers mulling pitches, students writing applications, parents trying to explain a complex, nuanced world and nudge children to explore more things they can pursue – anyone who needs to come up with new things worth pursuing. In short, you!</p>
                    
                <p class="gapB1">The snippets above and below give an indication of the range of topics (economics, language, science, geopolitics, maths, films, history, art, health, innovation and more).</p>
                      
                <p class="gapB2">But tweets have a character limit. Really the best way to get a feel for it is to read <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://angle.fyi/excerpt" target="_blank">this excerpt</a>.</p>

                <p class="gapB1" style="color: #000000; font-size: 0.9rem;">It’s not just what and how much to read, but why something is worth the time. The book will consistently put side by side, two things that you might otherwise not have. Because they might be from different times, different topics, different countries or simply not at all analogous at first glance. Creativity thrives on making new links between seemingly unrelated ideas.</p>
                      
                <p class="siz4 thic gapB1 drk">UNLEARN</p>
                     
                <p class="gapB1" style="color: #000000; font-size: 0.9rem;">It will also consistently try to show that the world is not what it seems and hence, more interesting and more complex than it appeared yesterday. An early chapter might contain stunning facts about a business or animal; in a subsequent one, it will show that even that was not the complete picture. That’s the second ‘why’. </p>

                <p class="gapB1" style="color: #000000; font-size: 0.9rem;">New ideas are how people set themselves apart. You well know that the more you read, the wider your horizon is, the sooner you will get that one original idea. But there’s no time to read it all! If you only have a few hours a month for calm retentive reading and wish you had a curated collection of bits that together puzzle the world out, stay tuned!</p>
